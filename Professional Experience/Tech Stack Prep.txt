1. Code Development
* Developer writes code using preferred IDE or editor.
2. Version Control with TFS
* Code is pushed to a TFS (Team Foundation Server) repository for version control and collaboration.
3. Build and Package
* TFS triggers a build pipeline:
    * Builds the code into executable artifacts (e.g., Docker images).
    * Packages dependencies.
4. Blob Storage
* Built artifacts and dependencies are stored in Azure Blob Storage for secure and scalable access.
5. Azure Container Apps
* Container Apps access and deploy the artifacts from Blob Storage.
* Container Apps run the application in a serverless environment, managing scaling and infrastructure for you.
6. User Interaction
* Users interact with the deployed application through web requests, API calls, or other interfaces.
Key Steps:
1. Code Development
2. Push code to TFS
3. TFS triggers build pipeline
4. Build pipeline creates artifacts and stores them in Blob Storage
5. Container Apps access artifacts from Blob Storage
6. Container Apps deploy and run application
7. Users interact with the application
Additional Considerations:
* Triggers: Consider using webhooks or triggers in TFS to automate pipeline execution upon code changes.
* Authentication and Authorization: Implement appropriate security measures to protect access to Blob Storage and Container Apps.
* Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring and logging tools to track application performance and health.
* Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD): Integrate these steps into a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for efficient application delivery.



Here's a guide on using Node.js, C#, Angular, TypeScript, and .NET to build a web application:
1. Project Structure:
* Separate Projects: Create two distinct projects:
    * Backend: ASP.NET Core project for API development using C# and .NET.
    * Frontend: Angular project for UI development using TypeScript, Node.js, and Angular CLI.
2. Backend Development (ASP.NET Core API):
* Create Project: Use Visual Studio or the .NET CLI to create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project.
* Define Models: Represent data entities using C# classes.
* Create Controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses, interacting with models and services.
* Implement Data Access: Connect to databases (if needed) using Entity Framework Core or other ORMs.
* Configure CORS: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend requests.
3. Frontend Development (Angular):
* Create Project: Use Angular CLI to generate a new Angular project.
* Define Components: Create reusable UI elements using TypeScript and Angular's component architecture.
* Implement Services: Encapsulate API interactions and data management logic.
* Make HTTP Requests: Use Angular's HttpClient to fetch data from the ASP.NET Core API.
* Manage State: Choose a state management approach (e.g., NgRx, store) for complex applications.
4. Communication and Integration:
* Frontend Calls Backend: The Angular app consumes the ASP.NET Core API endpoints to retrieve and send data.
* JSON Data Exchange: Use JSON format for data exchange between the frontend and backend.
* Separate Deployment: Deploy the frontend and backend independently, potentially to different servers or hosting platforms.
5. Considerations and Additional Tips:
* Project Organization: Use a clear folder structure to separate frontend and backend code.
* TypeScript Everywhere: Leverage TypeScript's type safety and tooling for both Angular and ASP.NET Core development.
* Testing: Implement thorough unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for both frontend and backend.
* Authentication and Authorization: Secure the application with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Deployment Strategies: Choose appropriate deployment options based on project requirements and infrastructure.
* Continuous Integration and Delivery: Set up CI/CD pipelines for efficient development and deployment.
* Version Control: Use Git for code versioning and collaboration.
* Explore Additional Tools and Libraries: Utilize helpful tools and libraries like Angular Material for UI components and Swagger for API documentation.
Remember:
* Node.js is primarily used for frontend development tools and package management in this setup.
* .NET provides the runtime for the ASP.NET Core backend.
* TypeScript enhances code quality and maintainability in both frontend and backend.

---------------------- In simple terms ------------------------------------


IndexedDb - alternative for local storage at client side- used it for storing data temporarily for like comparison 
When we had to store complex objects just instead of simple key value pairs
Used like session storage - only for my reference
Used while doing reset instead of calling api again
Azure Container Apps - this comes into picture after tfs gives a deployed code into an AWS server - these help in such a way that we give applications in form of containers which makes it globally available 
Blob Storage - used as s3
Azure SQL - our msSQL in azure cloud, need not to change anything.it offers migration of our existing databases.
Azure database for PostgreSQL
TFS - team foundation server - now referred as devops server. CI/CD practices will be done here 
CI/CD - every time we build the code, then it gets pushed into the build which gets deployed by release pipelines to AWS 
Azure VNet -isolated networks used for stopping or allowing traffic from particular ports or other data from internet or any other servers. by configuring NSG
Azure network security groups - in NSGs we define ports and params which should allow or deny - acts like a firewall
Angular 13
Node js
.net

Steps

1. Code Development
2. Push code to TFS
3. TFS triggers build pipeline
4. Build pipeline creates artifacts and stores them in GitHub
5. Container Apps access artifacts from github
6. Container Apps deploy and run application
7. Users interact with the application
